Team 2 developed a full-stack point of sale system using React, Nodejs and MySQL. This project provides all the functionality of an enterprise-level online store where users (customers) data are captured in the database, including their names, address, orders, email etc. Eachproduct created is linked to a user, and the same product is linked to buyer when a purchase happens.
